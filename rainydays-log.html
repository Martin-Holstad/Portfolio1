            <li>All the buttons was images made in adobe XD and are now changed to be divs with styling and the alt
                texts is removed from buttons since thats not needed.</li>
            <li>All products in the store hade a specific page for each item. That is no longer needed since the site is
                now dynamicly built, so all the unneeded pages are removed and links and other things that was connected
                to them are cleaned up.</li>
            <li>There is added hover effect on images in the store that makes the picture bigger when you mouse over it.
                this is added to show the user a better indication that you point at that item.</li>

                the page.</li>

            <li>Register forms had a problem that they would appear to the left instead of center in some browsers. That
